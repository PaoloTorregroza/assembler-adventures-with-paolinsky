# Paolinsky's fantastical adventure in the assembly world

In this repo I will put the different advances that I have in my assembly studies (while they last)

### My setup

1. Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS x64 (Elementary OS)
2. nasm 2.13.02
3. Visual studio code for code :3
4. (You need a bin folder inside the repo once downloaded)

### Compile and link

1. Compile: ``nasm -f elf64 File.asm``
2. Link: ``ld -s -o ./bin/File File.o``
3. Run ``./bin/File``

### Info UwU

This repo is 100% open source, you can use, copy, or change the code.

The only condition is that you have to have fun
